  </div><hr>
 <p><em><strong>Femboys are misrepresented online. </strong>Many people accidentally get the idea that being a femboy is "<a target='_blank' href='https://happymag.tv/femboy/'>a trend</a>" but that is simply not true. This webring is a way for feminine boys to share a community with people who truly understand what it means to be a femboy. To allow non-femboys to grasp that being a femboy is a part of our identity and that it is not just about appearance. </p></em><br>
   <h2 style="font-size: 30px;" class='title'>The Purpose</h2> <br> 
   <p>
 The true purpose of this website is to inform others about the existance of femboys. Meaning that we are not just following some trend, but that <strong>being a femboy is more than just the skirts and thighhighs. </strong>
